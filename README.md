# LIB-AV-ingestprep
A python script that automates digital preservation workflows in Emory Libraries Media Preservation.  The script facilitates pre-ingest tasks for audiovisual material intended for the Interim Storage Repository (LIB-AV): copying files to a staging directory, getting mediainfo metadata from files, moving files to the top level of the directory, renaming files according to the LIB-AV naming convention, and preparing and arranging the ingest csv.
